# Assignment Info

## Motivation
The reason I did all my assignments this semester and then compiled them (and one more table) into this dashboard was because it contains all the Premier League information that I'm interested in all in one easily accessible place. I can see team data, player data, and other stats that I'm interested in all in one place. All this data was pulled from other sources, but I cut out the data that I don't find as interesting.

## What I'm trying to communicate
I'm trying to communicate statistics of interest for the Premier League in a more simple, easy to use format.

## Options that I gave the user
I made the player data searchable and filterable to make it easier to find information of interest. I also gave interactive, less-common statistics (distribution of ages and the map with the number of players from each country) that I think people would find interesting. I was hoping to give multiple years, but the data required too much manipulation for my skill level with R.

## Why I chose each figure/table
2020 Results table - It gives an overall perspective of how the season went for each team. It's a good starting point with high level information.

Player Data 2020-2021 Table - Player data that could be of interest and is easily searchable and filterable. You can find out who had the most red cards or scored the most goals with just a couple of clicks

Number of Players by Country 2020 map - I hadn't thought of doing this one until we did the map assignment, but I think it's a cool Idea to kind of show where the players in one of the top soccer leagues in the world come from.

Play Time by Age graph - Just kind of a fun fact thing that isn't really surprising that most players are in their 20s, but I think it's cool to see how young and old some of the players can be.

Team Historical Trends - Kind of a busy plot, but it's interesting to see the win trends of some of the best teams from the league over the last 15 years, and to see how they generally perform.
